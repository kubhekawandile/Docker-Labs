# Docker Hands-On Project with GRC Insights

This repository contains my hands-on practice labs from KodeKloud, covering Docker basics to intermediate concepts. The labs focus on container management, images, CMD vs ENTRYPOINT, environment variables, networking, storage, Docker Compose, and detailed write-ups, and **GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) key takeaways**. The project demonstrates not only technical mastery of Docker but also how containerization impacts security, compliance, and operational governance.
