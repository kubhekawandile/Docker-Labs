# Docker Hands-On Project with GRC Insights

This repository contains my hands-on Docker labs from KodeKloud, covering basics to intermediate concepts. It includes container management, images, CMD vs ENTRYPOINT, environment variables, networking, storage, Docker Compose, detailed write-ups, and **GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) key takeaways**.  

The project demonstrates not only technical mastery of Docker but also how containerization impacts **security, compliance, and operational governance**.
